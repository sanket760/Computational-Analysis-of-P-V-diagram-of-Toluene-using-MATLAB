☆Course Project in CHE221, Prof. Vishal Agarwal.  
 
• Devised an algorithm in MATLAB to computationally plot and analyse the PV diagrams of Toluene using the SRK EOS. Utilized the concepts of Fugacity and Departure Function to estimate saturation points.
 
• Estimated critical point parameters. Plotted the isotherms and looked for a point satisfying derivative properties of critical point.
 
• Plotted Saturation curves for liquid and vapour phase, and marked the point of intersection. Compared both results with actual values.
